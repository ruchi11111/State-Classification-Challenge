# State-Classification-Challenge

Annotated a cooking dataset using cvat.org for the purpose of initial state recognition for robotic cook. Fed the dataset to pretrained models as well as an original model to compare the validation and test accuracies using PyTorch. 
Achieved a 55% of test accuracy using the original model and 80% using the pretrained VGG model.
